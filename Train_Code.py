Description:
    Creating a program to calculate train costs.

Assignment Information:
    Assignment:     Individual Project
    Team ID:        001 - 18
    Author:         Daniel Cardwell, dcardwe@purdue.edu

Contributors:
    Name, login@purdue [repeat for each]

    My contributor(s) helped me:
    [ ] understand the assignment expectations without
        telling me how they will approach it.
    [ ] understand different ways to think about a solution
        without helping me plan my solution.
    [ ] think through the meaning of a specific error or
        bug present in my code without looking at my code.
    Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
    have to list that person as a contributor here as well.

Academic Integrity Statement:
    I have not used source code obtained from any unauthorized
    source, either modified or unmodified; nor have I provided
    another student access to my code.  The project I am
    submitting is my own original work.
